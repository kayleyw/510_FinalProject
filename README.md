# 510 Final Project 
#### Kayley Wong

## Overview

This project is using trying to identify differential expressed genes between survivor and non-survivor male, white, and non-hispanic lung cancer patients using the `RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR` vignette. This is hoping to provide insights to which genes or pathways are related mortality in this subgroup of lung cancer patients. 

## Objectives
The analysis will be preform using workflow outlined by `RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR` vignette (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/limmaWorkflow.html#abstract). 

## Data
Data for this analysis is publicly available dataset obtain from National Cancer Institute GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). 

## Milestone 1
Obtain dataset from GDC Data Portal and reading them into RStudio. Pre-process the data according to the workflow from the vignette. 

## Milestone 2
Prepare Design Matrix and preform differential gene expression analysis and using the results to generate graphs.
